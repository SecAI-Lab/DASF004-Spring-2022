### Homework Assignment #1 (Due Apr. 8, 2022)
The homework assignment must be submitted on an individual basis. 
Please read the descriptions of each exercise carefully before you make a final submission to iCampus.

### Submission and Grading Policy
* You must submit a single zipped file via iCampus. The submission file name should be your student ID
with the file extension of .zip.
* We will consider the last submission only in case of multiple submissions.
* You write a program per each question where a naming rule is the question number with the file extension
of .c. For example, the program name of the first question would be 1.c.
* You have (up to) two days for a late submission with a 25% delay penalty per day.
* If your program fails to be compiled, no point would be given. This is a strict rule.
* You may obtain partial points based on test sets, which will be judged by the TAs.
* You must follow code of conduct. Keep in mind that any activity of copying, publishing, sharing your
code with others is not allowed. Violating code ethics may lead to failing this course.

### FAQs
* All questions clearly describe the format of inputs and outputs, thus you may assume them. 
For example, the inputs of Q1 would range from 1 to 15. An additional routine to check an input is not required.
* For compiling Q3, you should use the `-lm` option to be able to use C math functions as following:
```gcc -o 3 3.c -lm```
* For Q4, you must implement your own logic without using a format specifier (e.g., `0x%lX`).
* You do not need to have an infinitive loop for each question. The output examples are shown 
when a program separately runs with a particular input.
