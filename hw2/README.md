### Homework Assignment #2 (Due May 27, 2022)
The homework assignment must be submitted on an individual basis. 
Please read the descriptions of each exercise carefully before you make a final submission to iCampus.

### Submission and Grading Policy
* You must submit a single zipped file via iCampus. The submission file name should be your student ID
with the file extension of .zip.
* Unlike the first assignment, we use the Make utility for practice. However, Makefile will be given, so you
do not need to modify the file at all.
* We will consider the last submission only in case of multiple submissions.
* You have (up to) two days for a late submission with a 25% delay penalty per day.
* If your program fails to be compiled, no point would be given. This is a strict rule.
* You may obtain partial points based on test sets, which will be judged by the TAs.
* You must follow code of conduct. Keep in mind that any activity of copying, publishing, sharing your
code with others is not allowed. Violating code ethics may lead to failing this course.

### FAQs
* You may generate a single executable file with the `Make` utility with `Makefile`.
